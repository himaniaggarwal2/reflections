How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   By viewing 2 diff files together it helped by not going through each and every line and saving time ,efficiency inc ,and we could know where the changes are to be made.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   BY accessing through the entire history its gonna help by reading through our mistakes and knowing the progress we made over a period of time .

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    If gits gonna save the doc then other programmers can go through it will help others and us also  and other community member changes made will be visible . 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    its a great start and initiative by git to create a community to start off with sharing documents ,and keeping a track of our documents

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    no

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
