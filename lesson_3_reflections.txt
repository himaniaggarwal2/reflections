when would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks is used to transfer code from one user to other without downloading it into your local 
clones is used to clone the code from git hub to you local 
branches is when we want to make some changes to our code but dont want to disturb our original code and may be later on add our changes to main.
